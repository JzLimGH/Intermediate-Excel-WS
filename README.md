## The Essential Shortcuts
1. (Windows Only) You can use the alt key to manuever your Excel ribbon. 
Some key ones I use are:
  - HOI -> adjust column widths
  - HOA -> adjust row widths
  - AT -> creates filters for row headers
    - Hold Alt + down to access the filter bar without having to touch your mouse
  - AC -> Clear filter
  - HK -> sets cell format as number with commas
  - EL to delete sheets
    - SHIFT + F11 to make new sheets 
2. Moving around the Excel sheet.
  - Hold Ctrl + Direction keys in order to jump to an end of the data.
    - Holding shift along with this allows you to select multiple things quickly
  - F5 is the "GoTo" function which allows you to jump to specific cells.     
  - Home will bring you to cell A of whatever row you are on.
  - Page up and Page down allows you to scroll faster.
    - hold Alt while using page up and page down to scroll left and right faster.
3. etc
  - F2 allows you to enter edit mode for cells. 
  - F9 calculates the formula in the cell for you.
  - CRTL + Z to go back 
  - CRTL + Y to go forward
  - CRTL + X to cut
    - Be careful this one will cut all formatting as well
## The Pastas for copying
- Right click once you've copied something onto your clipboard. 
  - Bread and butter is paste values to avoid grabbing formulas that will give u gibberish.
  - Transpose is also useful
  - Link paste is useful when you want values to be combined to different sheets and update automatically
    - This leads to "Update Link" Messages when you open your worksheet.
ShortCut instead of right clicking is CRTL + ALT + V, but i actually prefer right clicking.
    - This option will also allow you to use the subtract/add paste which is useful for comparing numbers.
## Name Manager
The Name manager unde the "Formulas" ribbon allows users to manage specific cells by assigning them specific names. 
This is useful for managing other excel formulas(ex: Vlookup, offset).
You can quickly access all existing names in a worksheet by pressing the down arrow at the top left of your excel worksheet.
